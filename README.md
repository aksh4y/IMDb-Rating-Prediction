# Predicting Movie Ratings Using IMDb Dataset
A machine learning research project and paper analyzing the efficiency of different ML algorithms using evaluation metrics and drawing a comparison between them.
The data is split into training data and testing data in an 80:20 ratio in accordance with the Pareto Principle.
The algorithms analyzed in this project are: SVM, Random Forest, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes.

## Usage
Type the following command to run the program:
```python
python algorithm.py
```

The output will be something similar to:
```
